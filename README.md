# Enhanced ControlNet M2M for Stable Diffusion on RunPod

Welcome to my repository where I share an enhanced version of the `movie2movie.py` script, tailored for artists and creators using Stable Diffusion on RunPod.

## About the Script

This script is a modified version of the original `movie2movie.py` used in Stable Diffusion. It includes additional features and improvements to cater to the needs of artists, especially those working in cloud environments like RunPod.

### Key Enhancements
- **Video Path Input:** A new textbox for manual video path input, making it easier to use in cloud environments.
- **Improved Directory Handling:** The script now checks and creates output directories, ensuring smoother operation.
- **Enhanced Debugging:** Additional print statements for better troubleshooting and verification.

## Requirements
- Stable Diffusion installed on RunPod.
- "Allow other scripts to control this extension" option enabled in Stable Diffusion UI settings.
